                What if the solution for better AI models in multiple sclerosis (MS) research and care is to rethink the way we train these models? Federated learning allows training AI models without sharing data between hospitals. As a post-doctoral fellow of the FWO Flanders, I use this technique to better understand the relationship between structural brain damage and cognitive function in multiple sclerosis. With my clinical background as neurological physiotherapist (KU Leuven, Belgium), and my PhD on artificial intelligence in neuroimaging (VUB, Belgium), I use my interdisciplinary knowledge to deliver AI tools that improve life quality in people with MS. Topped with my creativity as a musician and science communicator, I hope to teach people with MS, their caregivers and clinicians about the wondrous world that is AI.
